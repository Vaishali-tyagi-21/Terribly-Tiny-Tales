# Terribly-Tiny-Tales

<h2>Terribly Tiny Tales Profile App</h2>
This project is a ReactJS based frontend application developed for the Terribly Tiny Tales assignment

<h2>Overview</h2>
The assignment involves creating a profile screen similar to <a href="https://www.terriblytinytales.com/profile.jpeg">this sample screenshot</a> from mobile view. The profile data is hardcoded in a local JSON, and no backend is required. The goal is to ensure consistent rendering across different mobile devices.
